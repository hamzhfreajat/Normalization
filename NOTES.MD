- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
The Z-Score and Min-Max help normalize the data, and what I understand is that sometimes we have data and in some cases this data can behave unexpectedly or it may fluctuate between normal and abnormal, so we need something as an indication about this Behavior, for example, a z-score of 0 is average, but 0.4 is out of normal, and so on .

what is unit testing and why would we use it?
